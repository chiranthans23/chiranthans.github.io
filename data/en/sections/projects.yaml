  role: Developer
  timeline: "December 2021 - March 2022"
  summary: This was a Named Entity Recognition competition hosted on Kaggle by George State University. I used Pytorch Lightning ⚡ framework along with DeepSpeed plugin - fp optim, scheduler, etc.. - to fasten the training framework. Trained on BigBird, Longformer, Ensemble of them and monitored using Wandb. Two Longformers ensemble was submitted.

  role: Developer
  timeline: "July 2021 - September 2021"
  summary: Used Dreddit dataset having social media conversations from Reddit. Auto EDA using Pandas profiling. Used BERT tokenizer from Hugging face for tokenizing text data. Various models were used and finally GBM, XGBoost and LGBM were used and they almost gave same scores. Optuna is used to tune the models. Weighted Voting classifier is implemented on above models.

  role: Developer
  timeline: "January 2018 - August 2018"
  summary: Few thousand Whatsapp messages were used to form a dataset, and was cleaned the dataset to be text-only. Used Tokenisation, POS tagging, and a customized Stemmer to further improve the dataset. A bag of emergency words was formulated, and important features were selected. The undersampled data from the dataset was trained on SVM classifier.

  role: Developer
  timeline: "August 2017 – May 2018"
  summary: Used a dataset of bank transactions. Normalized and Feature Engineered the dataset. The undersampled dataset was trained on multiple classifiers and evaluated the model using various statistical analysis parameters. Further, Reinforcement learning was used to track transactions in real-time. Finally, ExtraTrees gave the best accuracy and recall - 97.4% and 93.8%.

- name: Disease detection in pomegrenate leaves using Image processing
  logo: /images/sections/projects/matlab.png
  role: Developer
  timeline: "January 2018 – May 2018"
  summary: Pomegranate leaves images belonging to five categories of diseases were used to form a dataset. Used Image smoothing, Image enhancement, and Histogram equalization to pre-process images in MATLAB. Using K-means clustering, images were segmented. Mean, S.D, Smoothness, and do other properties were used as features. Classification of the image was done using Multi SVM classifier with 94.1% accuracy.
