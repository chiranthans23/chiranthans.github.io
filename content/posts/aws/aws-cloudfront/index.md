# AWS CloudFront

## Overview
- Content deliver network that helps in improving read performance
- Content is cached
- 216 points of presence or edge locations, globally
- DDoS protection, integration with shield, web app firewall
- Can exppose https and talk to internal https endpoints

## Cloudfront- Origins
- S3 bucket
    - Distributing files and caching at edge
    - Enhanced security with origin access identity(OAI)
    - used as ingress

- Custom origin
    - ALB
    - EC2
    - S3 website

## Cloudfront vs S3 cross origin
- Cloudfront is global, s3 co is to be done in every region
- Cloudfront caches for a TTL, S3 CO updates real-time
- CloudFront is suitable for static content, S3 CO for dynamic content to be available with low-latency in few regions

## CloudFront- S3
- Creat bucket and add few objects
- Go to cloud front and create distribution with origin domain name as the bucket created
- **Restrict bucket access** - makes user have access only through CF URL and not Bucket URL
- Create or use an OAI
- Create distribution - takes sometime( around 10 mins)
- Now an OAI would have been created and if we go to the bucket-> bucket policy-> we can see only OAI created will have access
- Once CF is ready we can try to access the object, it'll take time for CF to propogate to bucket(3-4 hours), till then we can make ACL and bucket ACL public and object as public, and  now we can see the object

## CloudFront - Caching 
- Caches based on- headers, session cookies, query string params
- Caching is based on TTL( 0 second to an year)
- CreateInvalidation API invalidates part of cache

- Because of caching if you change anything in an object and if the TTL is not crossed, the user will see older version of the object through CF
- Hence we can use CreateInvalidation for this problem
- CloudFront-> distribution-> invalidate-> create invalidation-> give the pattern of objects that's to be invalidated (* for all objects)
- Now even if there is any change in any object of the bucket, changes will be reflected


## CloudFront - Security
- OAI for S3 Buckets
- HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP to HTTPS restrictions
- Geo restriction
    - Can restrict based on location
    - Whitelist and blacklist, both can be done
    - use case- copyright laws for accessing content
    - CF distribution-> restrictions-> enable geo restriction-> whitelist/blacklist regions
    
## CloudFront signed URL/ signed cookies
- If you want to distribute paid shared content to users
- signed URL/ cookie can attach policy like
    - URL expiration
    - IP ranges
    - trusted signers
- Signed URL for individual files, cookies for multiple files(one cookie for many files)
