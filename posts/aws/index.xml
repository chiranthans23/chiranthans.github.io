bucket policy-&amp;gt; we can see only OAI created will have access Once CF is ready we can try to access the object, it&amp;rsquo;ll take time for CF to propogate to bucket(3-4 hours), till then we can make ACL and bucket ACL public and object as public, and now we can see the object CloudFront - Caching Caches based on- headers, session cookies, query string params Caching is based on TTL( 0 second to an year) CreateInvalidation API invalidates part of cache Because of caching if you change anything in an object and if the TTL is not crossed, the user will see older version of the object through CF Hence we can use CreateInvalidation for this problem CloudFront-&amp;gt; distribution-&amp;gt; invalidate-&amp;gt; create invalidation-&amp;gt; give the pattern of objects that&amp;rsquo;s to be invalidated (* for all objects) Now even if there is any change in any object of the bucket, changes will be reflected CloudFront - Security OAI for S3 Buckets HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP to HTTPS restrictions Geo restriction Can restrict based on location Whitelist and blacklist, both can be done use case- copyright laws for accessing content CF distribution-&amp;gt;
